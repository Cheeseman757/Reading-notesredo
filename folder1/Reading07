Explain why we need domain modeling.
•	Domain modeling is needed to create a visual and conceptual representation of the data and interactions within a specific domain of interest. It helps in understanding the problem space, identifying the key entities and their relationships, and facilitates communication among stakeholders, leading to a more structured and efficient approach to software development.
Why should tables not be used for page layouts?
•	Tables should not be used for page layouts because they are intended for tabular data, not layout control. Using tables for layout can lead to accessibility issues, make the content harder to read and maintain, and result in poor performance on mobile devices. CSS layout techniques like Flexbox and Grid are more semantically correct and flexible for designing layouts.
List and describe 3 different semantic HTML elements used in an HTML <table>.
1.	<table> - Represents a table.
2.	<tr> - Stands for table row; it is used to group a set of table cells together, forming a row.
3.	<td> - Represents a table data cell containing the actual data.
4.	<th> - Represents a table header cell; used for column or row headers.
What is a constructor and what are some advantages to using it?
•	A constructor is a special function used to create and initialize objects in a class. Advantages include code reusability, clarity in object creation, and the ability to set initial object properties and methods at the moment of instantiation.
How does the term this differ when used in an object literal versus when used in a constructor?
•	In an object literal, this refers to the current object context in which it is used. In a constructor, this refers to the instance of the object being created by the constructor.
Explain prototypes and inheritance via an analogy from your previous work experience.
•	Imagine a company where every new employee gets a standard set of tools and guidelines (prototype) from their department. As they gain experience, they can add new skills (properties) and methods (functions) to their repertoire, which are specific to their role but still have the base tools and guidelines. Inheritance in objects works similarly: an object can inherit properties and methods from a prototype, yet have the ability to add or override them as needed, just like employees using the standard set of tools while also developing unique skills.
